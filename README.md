This project was for BIO549 with Dr. Nate Upham in Fall Semester 2025.

# Overview 

Download trait information on the group of organisms (e.g., geographic, ecological, or morphological data) and map it on their phylogeny to test eco-evolutionary hypotheses. Ideally, this would use the phylogeny that you constructed in the PP, but that is not required.

# Final Paper

The final write up can be found in the deliverables folder. 

# Interesting Figures and Tables
